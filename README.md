## Thanks

The recurrence calculation code of `RecurrencRule`s is mostly a partial port of [<kbd>rrule.js</kbd>], though with a lot of modifications to use [<kbd>time_machine</kbd>] and not having to do date/time calculations manually. You can find the license of [<kbd>rrule.js</kbd>] in the file `LICENSE-rrule.js.txt`.
